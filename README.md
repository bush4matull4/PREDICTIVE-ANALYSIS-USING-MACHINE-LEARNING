Heart Disease Prediction – Big Data Analysis
📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates Big Data Analysis using PySpark / Pandas on a large heart disease dataset. The goal is to predict the presence of heart disease using various features like age, sex, cholesterol, chest pain type, and more.
🧰 Tools & Technologies

    Python

    Pandas / NumPy

    Scikit-learn

    Matplotlib / Seaborn

    Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

    PySpark or Dask (if used)

📂 Dataset

    Source: Kaggle - Heart Disease Train-Test Dataset

🛠️ Steps Performed

    Data Cleaning

        Removed nulls

        Encoded categorical variables

        Converted text values (e.g., "Zero", "One") to numbers

    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

        Count plots for target variable

        Box plots of features vs target

    Feature Engineering

        One-hot encoding

        Feature scaling using StandardScaler

        Feature selection using SelectKBest

    Model Building

        Split data into training and testing

        Trained Logistic Regression model

        Evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
